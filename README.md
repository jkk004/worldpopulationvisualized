# Most Populous Cities

Used basic features from matplotlib and panda to make a program where it takes an input from 1900-2020 and output the 12 most populous cities of that year. Used this database that I found to get the numbers. https://gist.githubusercontent.com/johnburnmurdoch/4199dbe55095c3e13de8d5b2e5e5307a/raw/fa018b25c24b7b5f47fd0568937ff6c04e384786/city_populations
